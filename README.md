# Tmux configuration files

First ensure that tmux has already been installed.
This setup is inspired by [dreamsofcode-io's setup](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/tmux)



- To clone on Linux and Mac
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chrhjoh/tmux.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/tmux
```

After installation start tmux

```sh
tmux
```

This then installs the tmux plugin manager (tpm) and other plugins
